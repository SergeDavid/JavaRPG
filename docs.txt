Design ideas and what not so I don't have to nest everything in comments through the code.

-------------
--- Magic ---
-------------
System
  a) Create a menu in the battle system to use a magic ability.
  b) Equip a single magic ability or abilities (Maybe 2 or 3 total so you can't have magic for all occasions!)
Abilities
  *) Flash, blinds your opponent slightly making attacks on you slightly less forth comming, except on monsters who like it.
  *) Magic Missile, of course you need this generic gem.
  *) Gun (Because I CAN), instead of using magic points it takes a random item (standard items only like potions),
  and then shoots it dealing damage based on its cost (-1 to the items count because you shot it out of a magic gun).
  Also I need to make a very expensive item called a Bullet (Expensivish and lots of damage, but does nothing else)
  *) Haste / Slow (pretty standard)
  *) Other stat effecting magics
  *) Toxic is another default one I need to add.
Spell Casting
  *) Epic Failure (Spell blows up in your face)
  *) Miss (nothing happens, it sucks when you say your spell out of order or leave the safety on)
  *) Hit (normal thing happens)
  *) Extra umph (bigger and better explosions, but probably hurts you a little)

----------------
--- Graphics ---
---------------- 
  *) Rework the grid and make everything 8x8 or 16x16 (currently 1x1 on everything)
  *) Rework the way everything is drawn to the canvas, I'm thinking something like having a width*height array filled with color data repusenting each pixel.
  This gives me a lot of options on drawing things to the canvas as I can remove alphas from the img (makes it smaller) and reuse more tiles by tinting them.
  Though I'll probably have to decrease the palette which might be better for the game anyway.
  My biggest consern is how long it would take each rendering cycle if I implement it in a stupid way, though I don't think it would be much slower then my current method of drawing images with a lot more color varients.
  With this I could also theoretically implement color blending and tinting (ghosts, OooOoooOOOOoo)

----------------------
--- Map Generation ---
----------------------
  *) I really want to set it up so that it is randomly generated locations with different variables added
  	   1) Theme (island, cave, volcano, forrest / plains)
  	   2) Important things (Towns, Bosses, Teleports as in boats, cave enterences, etc)
  	   3) Boss placement (blocking the paths to important things)

------------
--- Code ---
------------
  *) Put Hero and Monster in the Entity.js and just fill them with the stats of Entity (for monsters just copy+paste their stats from Enemies.js->Enemies->Rat)
  *) Finish redesigning the menuState system (changing from numbers to enums for easy changes)
  *) Add in a very crappy weapon, armor, helmet, and magic that you can't sell so you'll always have a default thing to use.
	 Currently though I'm using a -1 item for filler, I tried offsetting everything by +1 and then -1 when used but it didn't like that either.

---------------
--- Effects ---
---------------
  *) Add in some movement to the different states like grass / water movement in the world map and maybe a cursor / selection box blink to further show what you are pointed at
  *) indicator pop ups such as damage, healing, level up, etc.
  *) State transitions like world to battle
