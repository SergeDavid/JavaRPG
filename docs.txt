Design ideas and what not so I don't have to nest everything in comments through the code.

-----------------
--- Bugs List ---
-----------------
	*) Helmet equip menu is currently broken.
		*) Owning 1 Iron Helm doesn't show up on the list to select.
		*) If added a Steel Helm "Nothing" option is hidden, and you can scroll off the list by hitting the down arrow again when you reach the last option.
	*) Potential bugs from removing the auto menuPointer = 0; when pressing cancel.
------------------------------
--- Unimplimented Features ---
------------------------------
	*) Battle speed setting (decreases how many ticks it takes to preform actions)
	*) Saving and loading the game
	*) Magic
	*) Monsters loaded based on certain stats
		*) Each area has a level range (such as lvl 5 to 15 which monsters will pop up randomly between those two levels)
		*) Monsters will be picked randomly from the base stats (bosses are placed differently or an extra 10/20 levels)
		*) So it is something like 5str + 2str * level + 5str * level&5
	*) Smaller tile footprint (Instead of 32x32 I want it to be something like 8x8)
		*) On a 1/4th sized map (player is 4x the size of tiles) his footprint would be something like
			 00 
			0000
			0000
			 00 
	*) Blocking an item from being used when it causes no effects, like trying to use a potion when you are at max health.
	*) Add in more functions to the item name highlighter, such as greying out items you can't use (target.enemy when in your inventory or a potion when your at max health)
	*) Randomly generates the maps based on a theme such as a volcanic island (generally a big circle as the volcano is in the middle and the ocean is on the outside)
	*) Add in an option for full screen


--------------
--- Menues ---
--------------
  Todo) Magic Menu in Battle
  Todo) Item Menu in Battle
  Todo) Connect the inventory menu with item.Use()
  Todo) Add a credit like thing to the game over menu
  Todo) Add some stuff to the town front menues

-------------
--- World ---
------------- 
  Volcanic Island) You first start out on a beach near the single town on the island, this map leads to two locations (volcanoe and sunken cave)
  Volcanoe) A boss is on the other side, when it dies the sunken cave is slightly drained so you can pass through it.
  Sunken Cave) You can't pass through it until the first boss is killed, another boss blocks the exit to a coastline
  Coastline) Two towns are here and three different paths, Forrest, Desert, Plains.

-------------
--- Magic ---
-------------
Using in Battle
  *) Open the spell menu in battle when it is your turn
  	 *) Might set it up so you can only access three different spells at a time in battle
  *) All spells use magic to work. (I might want to do a hp -> mana converter, but alas too much work) 
Abilities
  *) Flash, blinds your opponent slightly making attacks on you slightly less forth comming, except on monsters who like it.
  *) Magic Missile, of course you need this generic gem.
  *) Gun (Because I CAN), instead of using magic points it takes a random item (standard items only like potions),
  and then shoots it dealing damage based on its cost (-1 to the items count because you shot it out of a magic gun).
  Also I need to make a very expensive item called a Bullet (Expensivish and lots of damage, but does nothing else)
  *) Haste / Slow (pretty standard)
  *) Other stat effecting magics
  *) Toxic is another default one I need to add.
Spell Casting
  *) Epic Failure (Spell blows up in your face)
  *) Hit (normal thing happens)
  *) Extra umph (bigger and better explosions, but probably hurts you a little)

----------------
--- Graphics ---
---------------- 
  *) Rework the grid and make everything 8x8 or 16x16 (currently 1x1 on everything)
  *) Rework the way everything is drawn to the canvas, I'm thinking something like having a width*height array filled with color data repusenting each pixel.
  This gives me a lot of options on drawing things to the canvas as I can remove alphas from the img (makes it smaller) and reuse more tiles by tinting them.
  Though I'll probably have to decrease the palette which might be better for the game anyway.
  My biggest consern is how long it would take each rendering cycle if I implement it in a stupid way, though I don't think it would be much slower then my current method of drawing images with a lot more color varients.
  With this I could also theoretically implement color blending and tinting (ghosts, OooOoooOOOOoo)

----------------------
--- Map Generation ---
----------------------
  *) I really want to set it up so that it is randomly generated locations with different variables added
  	   1) Theme (island, cave, volcano, forrest / plains)
  	   2) Important things (Towns, Bosses, Teleports as in boats, cave enterences, etc)
  	   3) Boss placement (blocking the paths to important things)

------------
--- Code ---
------------
  *) Put Hero and Monster in the Entity.js and just fill them with the stats of Entity (for monsters just copy+paste their stats from Enemies.js->Enemies->Rat)
  *) Finish redesigning the menuState system (changing from numbers to enums for easy changes)
  *) Add in a very crappy weapon, armor, helmet, and magic that you can't sell so you'll always have a default thing to use.
	 Currently though I'm using a -1 item for filler, I tried offsetting everything by +1 and then -1 when used but it didn't like that either.

---------------
--- Effects ---
---------------
  *) Add in some movement to the different states like grass / water movement in the world map and maybe a cursor / selection box blink to further show what you are pointed at
  *) indicator pop ups such as damage, healing, level up, etc.
  *) State transitions like world to battle
